# Whale Lair, Bonding and Distribution of Fees

The Whale Lair is a bonding contract used to bond WHALE LSDs such as ampWHALE and bWHALE. The Lair handles the bonding, unbonding and withdrawing of previously unbonded assets. The bonding contract maintains a time weighted multiplier which is used to incentivize long term bonding. 

Epochs are maintained and used by the lair to determine the users weight in relation to the global weight. 
The Fee Distribution contract is used to distribute the fees collected by the Liquidity Hub to the bonded users of the whale lair.
