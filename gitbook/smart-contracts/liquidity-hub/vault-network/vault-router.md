# Vault Router

The vault router contract is a convenient way to take flash loans from White Whale vaults. Instead of interacting with 
individual vaults, bots can request the vault router the desired asset to do the flash loan operation with and the router 
will take care of communicating and requesting the funds to the appropriate vault.

An interesting feature that the White Whale Vault Router is pioneering is the possibility to take multiple flash loans at 
once.

The code for the vault router can be found [here](https://github.com/White-Whale-Defi-Platform/migaloo-core/tree/main/contracts/liquidity_hub/vault-network/vault_router).

The following are the messages that can be executed on the vault router:

## Instantiate

Instantiates the vault router.

```json
{
  "owner": "inj1...",
  "vault_factory_addr": "inj1..."
}
```

| Key                  | Type   | Description                       |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `owner`              | String | The owner of the router           |
| `vault_factory_addr` | String | The address for the vault factory |

## Migrate

Migrates the vault router.

```json
{}
```

## ExecuteMsg

## Flashloan

Retrieves the desired `assets` and runs the `msgs`, paying the required amount back the vaults after running the messages, 
and returning the profit to the sender.

```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "info": {
        "native_token": {
          "denom": "ujuno"
        }
      },
      "amount": "10000"
    }
  ],
  "msgs": [
    {
      "wasm": {
        "execute": {
